Just another workbook which is in my programming self-education plan. Although C is not my primary language (has not been yet?), I consider learning it as a highly useful exercise (with very probable future use in the real practice). C is immortal, it is much like the Aristotle "Logic" or K. Marx's "Capital" but in the world of programming - it makes you think and - eventually - get free.

As this is a workbook, I save everything in the JupyterNB file. All the exercises do I in the "draft.c" file and then copy the code into the JupyterNB, so one can check every exercise by copying the code into the .c file and running it in the terminal (I did not search for a solution how to make the C Jupyter kernel to work in the interactive mode, that's not an issue I want to spend time on, so I use vim and terminal).
