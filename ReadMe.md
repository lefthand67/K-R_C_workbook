Just another workbook which is in my programming self-education plan. Although C is not my primary language (has not been yet?), I consider learning it as a highly useful exercise (with very probable future use in the real practice). C is immortal, it is much like the Aristotle "Logic" or K. Marx's "Capital" but in the world of programming - it makes you think and - eventually - get free.
