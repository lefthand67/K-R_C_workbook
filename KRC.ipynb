    "Many of the important ideas of C stem from the language BCPL, developed by Martin Richards. The influence of BCPL on C proceeded indirectly through the language B, which was written by Ken Thompson in 1970 for the first UNIX system on the DEC PDP−7.\n",

    "BCPL and B are **typeless** languages. By contrast, C provides a variety of data types. The fundamental types are characters, and integers and floating point numbers of several sizes. In addition, there is a hierarchy of derived data types created with pointers, arrays, structures and unions. Expressions are formed from operators and operands; any expression, including an assignment or a function call, can be a statement. Pointers provide for machine−independent address arithmetic."

    "Every time the program encounters the first character of a word, it counts one more word. The variable state records whether the program is currently in a word or not; initially it is “not in a word,” which is assigned the value `OUT`. We prefer the symbolic constants `IN` and `OUT` to the literal values `1` and `0` because they make the program more readable. In a program as tiny as this, it makes little difference, but in larger programs, the increase in clarity is well worth the modest extra effort to write it this way from the beginning. You’ll also find that it’s easier to make extensive changes in programs where magic numbers appear only as symbolic constants.\n",
    "***\n",
    "ChatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"**magic numbers**\" refers to literal or hardcoded numerical values that are used in programming without any clear explanation of their meaning or purpose. These numbers are often arbitrary and seem to have a special significance within the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The passage you mentioned refers to the use of symbolic constants (such as `IN` and `OUT`) instead of literal values (such as `1` and `0`) to improve the readability and maintainability of the code. By using symbolic constants, the code becomes more self-explanatory and easier to understand, as the meaning and purpose of these values are explicitly stated through the constants' names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using symbolic constants instead of magic numbers provides several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability**: The code becomes more human-readable, as the symbolic constants have meaningful names that convey their purpose and intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: If the value of a particular constant needs to be changed in the future, it only needs to be modified at one location, rather than searching for all occurrences of the magic number throughout the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code clarity and understanding**: By using symbolic constants, the code becomes self-documenting, making it easier for other programmers (including the original developer) to understand and modify the code later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: By defining values as symbolic constants, the code becomes more flexible and adaptable to changes. If the program requirements change and certain values need to be adjusted, it can be done easily by modifying the constants' definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In larger programs, where changes and modifications are more frequent, avoiding the use of magic numbers by replacing them with symbolic constants becomes even more essential. This approach enhances the code's readability, maintainability, and overall quality.\n",

There is a corresponding operator `&&` for `AND`; its precedence is just higher than `||`. Expressions connected by `&&` or `||` are evaluated left to right, and it is guaranteed that evaluation will stop as soon as the truth or falsehood is known. If `c` is a blank, there is no need to test whether it is a newline or tab, so these tests are not made. This isn’t particularly important here, but is significant in more complicated situations, as we will soon see.\n",

    "> A note of history: The biggest change between ANSI C and earlier versions is how functions are declared and defined. In the original definition of C, the `power` function would have been written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "/* power:  raise base to n-th power; n >= 0 */\n",
    "/* (old-style version) */\n",
    "power(base, n)\n",
    "int base, n;\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int i, p;\n",
    "\n",
    "    p = 1;\n",
    "    for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n",
    "        p = p * base;\n",
    "    return p;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters are named between the parentheses, and their types are declared before the opening left brace; undeclared parameters are taken as `int`. (The body of the function is the same as before.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The declaration of `power` at the beginning of the program would have looked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int power();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No parameter list was permitted, so the compiler could not readily check that `power` was being called correctly. Indeed, since by default `power` would have been assumed to return an `int`, the entire declaration might well have been omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new syntax of function prototypes makes it much easier for a compiler to detect errors in the number of arguments or their types. The old style of declaration and definition still works in ANSI C, at least for a transition period, but we strongly recommend that you use the new form when you have a compiler that supports it."

    "The variables in `main`, such as `line`, `longest`, etc., are **private** or **local** to main. Because they are declared within `main`, no other function can have direct access to them. The same is true of the variables in other functions; for example, the variable `i` in `getline` is unrelated to the `i` in `copy`. Each local variable in a function comes into existence only when the function is called, and disappears when the function is exited. This is why such variables are usually known as **automatic variables**, following terminology in other languages. We will use the term automatic henceforth to refer to these local variables. (**Chapter 4** discusses the `static` storage class, in which local variables do retain their values between calls.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not retain their values from one call to the next, and must be explicitly set upon each entry. If they are not set, they will contain **garbage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to automatic variables, it is possible to define variables that are external to all functions, that is, variables that can be accessed by name by any function. (This mechanism is rather like Fortran `COMMON` or Pascal variables declared in the outermost block.) Because **external variables** are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between functions. Furthermore, because external variables remain in existence permanently, rather than appearing and disappearing as functions are called and exited, they retain their values even after the functions that set them have returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "An external variable must be \n",
    "- **defined**, exactly once, outside of any function; this sets aside storage for it. \n",
    "- **declared** in each function that wants to access it; this states the type of the variable. The **declaration** may be an explicit `extern` statement or may be implicit from context. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the discussion concrete, let us rewrite the `longest-line` program with `line`, `longest`, and `max` as external variables. This requires changing the calls, declarations, and bodies of all three functions:"

But external variables are always there even when you don’t want them. Relying too heavily on external variables is fraught with peril since it leads to programs whose data connections are not at all obvious — variables can be changed in unexpected and even inadvertent ways, and the program is hard to modify. The second version of the `longest-line` program is inferior to the first, partly for these reasons, and partly because it destroys the generality of two useful functions by wiring into them the names of the variables they manipulate."

    "Encapsulation and modularity are both principles in software design that aim to improve the organization, ease of maintenance, and reusability of code. While they share similarities, there are differences between the two concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation** refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class in object-oriented programming. This allows for better control over the accessibility of the data and operations, as well as hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world. This can be achieved in C using structures or in modern C using the concept of **opaque pointers**, where data members are hidden from direct access and are accessed only through specific functions or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modularity**, on the other hand, is the concept of breaking down the software into smaller, self-contained units (modules) that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. Each module typically has a well-defined interface through which it communicates with other modules, allowing for easier understanding, maintenance, and reuse of code. In modern C, modularity can be achieved through the use of header files and separating code into different source files, each containing related functions and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of modern C, encapsulation is more about controlling access to the data and implementation details within a module, while modularity is about breaking down the software into smaller, reusable components that can be developed and maintained independently. Both principles are important for creating clear, maintainable, and efficient software systems."
